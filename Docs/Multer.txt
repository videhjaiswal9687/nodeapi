npm install multer

Multer in Node. js is a middleware that is used for the easy handling of multipart/form-data that is used when file uploading is done.

The disk storage engine gives you full control on storing files to disk.

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, '/tmp/my-uploads')
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9)
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + uniqueSuffix)
  }
})

const upload = multer({ storage: storage })

There are two options available, destination and filename. They are both functions that determine where the file should be stored.

destination is used to determine within which folder the uploaded files should be stored. This can also be given as a string (e.g. '/tmp/uploads'). If no destination is given, the operating system’s default directory for temporary files is used.

filename is used to determine what the file should be named inside the folder. If no filename is given, each file will be given a random name that doesn’t include any file extension.
